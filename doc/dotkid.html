      <h1>Dotkid</h1>
      The dotkid sprite's origin is 9 pixels above the bottom of the sprite, the same as the normal kid's sprite. Dotkid also uses the same exact code as the regular kid; no special behavior. This implementation makes platforms work consistently with dotkid, and that's why I did it this way. Note that there's no official implementation of dotkid, and that other implementations might work slightly differently than this one.
