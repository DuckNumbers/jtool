      If you see a pop-up like the following, do not despair! You can download dll files you are missing from random websites. Just google the name of the dll you're missing and download it from a somewhat sketchy-looking website. dll-files.com pops up a lot. Then you can try putting the dll in the jtool folder.

      A disclaimer: I don't know what these missing dlls are, or what the best way to obtain them is, or if the above method is safe. I just don't care to put in the effort to find out. It's frustrating to deal with. Sorry, and good luck.
