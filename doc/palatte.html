      The palatte refers to the selction of placeable objects in the sidebar. The object "oPalatte" controls the logic and drawing of the palatte.
      <h2>How the palatte object data</h2>
      In the draw event of oPalatte, a gigantic switch statement holds the data for all the palatte elements. Each iteration of the for loop does the button for one of these elements. If you add, remove, or swap elements be sure that the number preceding each case statement is unique.
      <h2>How the palatte draws and does logic</h2>
      For each element, the palatte draws a button (with the appropriate sprite, etc) and checks if it was clicked this step. If it was clicked, it sets the selected_object and other variables in the object "oEdit."
