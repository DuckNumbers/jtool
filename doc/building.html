      <h1>Building</h1>
      Here's the steps to follow if you want to build the game from source yourself, so you can make tweaks, browse the code, etc. If you're making customized UI or similar tweaks, please let me know so that I might add them to the official version.
      <h2>1. Get the source</h2>
      Download the source from <a href="https://github.com/patrickgh3/jtool">its Github repo</a>. You can click the "Download Zip" button on the right of the page.
      <h2>2. Download and import GMFileSystem</h2>
      <a href="http://gmc.yoyogames.com/index.php?showtopic=567528">Link here.</a> In GameMaker, Right click on the Extensions folder and click Import Extension. Select the *.gex file extension in the dialog, and open the extension file.
      <h2>3. Set up project path</h2>
      In the script mainInit, set global.editor_project_path to be the folder which contains the "skins" folder. This is used for saving and loading skins and the config file when running the game from GM.
      <h2>4. Have fun!</h2>
      If you're having trouble building from source, and you've double-checked and troubleshooted stuff, feel free to contact me and I'll try to help you out.
