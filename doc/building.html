      <h1>Building</h1>
      Here's steps to follow if you want to build the game from source yourself.
      <h2>1. Download and import GMFileSystem</h2>
      <a href="http://gmc.yoyogames.com/index.php?showtopic=567528">Link here.</a> Right click on the Extensions folder and click Import Extension. Select the *.gex file extension in the dialog, and open the extension file.
      <h2>2. Set up project path</h2>
      In the script mainInit, set global.editor_project_path to be the folder which contains the "skins" folder. This is used for saving and loading skins and the config file when running the game from GM.
      <h2>3. Have fun!</h2>
