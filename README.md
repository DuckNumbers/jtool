Jump tool (for lack of a better name)
---

A tool for guy game players and creators to practice advanced techniques and design intricate platforming. For a long time, the community has used [RMJ](http://delicious-fruit.com/ratings/game_details.php?id=12455) by TheNewGeezer, which is a great tool, but it lacks a few features and its UI is quirky in a few places. I had the motivation to make this tool and make it well, so here we are.

The guy game community is a small but passionate group fascinated with a very niche kind of game genre. Guy games are platformers with a particular set of physics, intricate platforming, a whole slew of tropes and sub-genres, and filled to the brim with charm. Most all guy games are made in GameMaker, so I made this tool in GameMaker to perfectly emulate the player physics.

As of this writing I've been working on this for just under a month, and most of the core features are implemented. The plan is to work on it some more, then once things are stable implement feedback from testers. The official release date is Soonâ„¢.
