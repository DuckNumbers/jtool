      <h1>jtool Documentation Index</h1>
      jtool aims to be good for both investigating precise needle and designing needle stages. I made it because RMJ is such an invaluable tool in the community, yet it lacked a lot of features and was a bit quirky in my eyes. Oh, and also because I happened to have the time to do it.
      <br><br>
      Jtool is made by me, Patrickgh3. Please contact me with bug reports (be descriptive), feature ideas, general feedback, and love notes. I'm on Skype often as "patrickgh3", and my email is <a href="mailto:patrickjtraynor@gmail.com">patrickjtraynor@gmail.com</a>. I stream sometimes on my <a href="http://www.twitch.tv/patrickgh3">Twitch Channel</a>. I'm also on <a href="https://github.com/patrickgh3">Github</a> and maybe <a href="https://twitter.com/clockworkpat">Twitter</a> if you're into those sort of things.
      <br><br>
      Special thanks to: YoYoYoDude1 for his GMStudio engine, TheNewGeezer for the original RMJ, and everyone who gave feedback, feature ideas, and encouragement; you know who you are.
